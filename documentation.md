Project Overview
The car catalog project is an online platform that allows customers to browse a catalog of cars available at a store. The project is designed to provide a convenient and easy-to-use interface for customers to view and learn about different car models, features, and pricing. The target audience for this project is anyone who is interested in purchasing a car and wants to browse a catalog of available options.

Key Features
•	A catalog of available car models with detailed information on features, pricing, and specifications.
•	A user-friendly interface that makes it easy for customers to navigate through the catalog.
Project Architecture
The car catalog project is built using a combination of Angular for the front-end, Express for server-side rendering, and MongoDB for the database. The architecture of the project is structured as follows:

•	The Angular front-end handles the user interface and interaction with the catalog. It communicates with the server through a series of RESTful APIs.
•	The Express server handles server-side rendering and serves as the back-end for the Angular (front-end). It connects to the MongoDB database to retrieve and store data related to the car catalog.
•	The MongoDB database stores the data for the car catalog, including information on car models, features, and pricing. It stores the data for the user, including his username, email  and hashed password.
